## About

This web-based application is being developed with three characteristics in mind:

- **Accessibility**: We want everyone to be able to map out their infastructures and generate security reports on any operating-system and on any browser.
- **Aesthetics**: We're tired of clunky, boring interfaces - we want to bring the pizazz into threat-modeling.
- **Intuitive User-Experience**: We hate manuals, and we want you to be able to use this software without one.
