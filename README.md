SeaSponge
=========

SeaSponge is an accessible web-based threat modeling tool developed for Mozilla Winter of Security 2014. 

This web-based application is being developed with three characteristics in mind:

* **Accessibility**: We want everyone to be able to map out their infastructures and generate security reports on any operating-system and on any browser. 
* **Aesthetics**: We're tired of clunky, boring interfaces - we want to bring the pizazz into threat-modeling.
* **Intuitive User-Experience**: We want you to be able to use the software without a manual.
